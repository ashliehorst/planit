                    <h1>What does it do?</h1>
                    <p>Plan is made to help people in an area find events that may interest them. After performing numerous surveys, design iterations, and user tests, we have come up with a prototype that we are happy with. Here’s what you can do with it:</p>

                    <h3>See the details</h3>
                    <p>Click or touch on an event to see the details present.</p>
                    <p>The details available here are:</p>

                        <p>We discovered that most people do not plan further out than 2 weeks for activities they are interested in. Hence, we chose to have a quick way to get access to the events for two weeks.</p>
                        <p>Instead of choosing a date in a drop down form, we chose to create a date slider. This provides fast access for mobile and tablet users to be able to adjust the date they are wanting.</p>

                        <p>We would love to be able to search by category, but we found that it was too ambiguous.  Instead, our events are labeled with categorical icons to express what the category belongs to.</p>

                        <p>We believe in designing for the mobile version of this application first.</p>
                        <p>Currently the tablet and desktop designs and developments are not available.</p>

                        <h2 class="text-center">Sorting by Time & Price</h2>
                        <p>We discovered that there was a unanimous agreement among user (based on our testing) that the time and cost of the event were the most important (followed closely by location).</p>
                        <p>Hence, we chose to develop the application using objects that could work quickly to be sorted on the client side.</p>
                        <p>Once one of the sorting buttons have been selected, any new date selected will have the sort feature applied to it for the selected button.</p>

                        <p>We wanted a way to find activities to do on campus in a fast way. Hence, the events that are in this application are from BYU-Idaho.</p>
                        <p>The event information is extracted from the RSS feed of the BYU-Idaho calendar, saved as events to our database, and loaded up into our application as objects.</p>

                        <p>The point of this application is to enhance event awareness. To do this, it will be wise for us to import public events into our system. That way you can start advertising that garage sale of yours somewhere besides CraigsList!</p>

                        <p>We would love for our system to be able to not only allow our users to view events, but save them to their calendar! Get all of the monotonous data entry stuff out of the way!</p>
